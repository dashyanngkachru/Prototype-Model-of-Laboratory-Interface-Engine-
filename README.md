# Prototype Model of Laboratory Interface Engine

Implementing this interface engine will provide laboratory departments to transfer information about an order such as lab test.

In my project, I have made use of only the ORM message. We have used ORM-001. With the help of ORM message in our database we have created the template and its corresponding mapping file. These are then segregated together and processed further to generate the flat file output. The individual flat file output for a single patient entry can be created.

This interface engine provides a framework for the exchange, integration, sharing and retrieval of electronic health information in a desired standard format. This has been designed on Microsoft Visual Basic 2010 and uses Microsoft Access 2007 for database management.
